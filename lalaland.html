                Jacob Koller's piano medley from "La La Land" is emotionally
                draining due to its poignant portrayal of unfulfilled 
                dreams and bittersweet love. 
                The delicate melodies evoke a powerful sense of yearning, 
                reminding listeners of the characters' sacrifices and aspirations. 
                Themes like "Mia and Sebastian's Theme" encapsulate the 
                tension between passion and compromise, resonating deeply 
                with anyone who has faced similar struggles. 
                This combination of nostalgia and raw emotion creates a 
                lasting impact, making the experience both beautiful and 
                heart-wrenching.
